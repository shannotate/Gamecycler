added this thing to this file

	I pushed the few things I have done so far, including the short paragraph required.
	I also changed and moved a few things around on the kanban, and included a screenshot,
but I the tasks I created are very general, so, if you wanna change anything about it, feel free.
	The template I picked looks a bit too blog-ish for me, so once again if either of you find a
new one that you like better, that's okay with me.
